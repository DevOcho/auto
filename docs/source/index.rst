Welcome to Auto's documentation!
================================

Auto aims to be a one stop shop for local development on k3d/k3s.  It allows you to run a complete
k3s environment, start and stop your services/portals, install databases, etc.

When you are ready to code, you can just type `auto start` and let it do its thang.
